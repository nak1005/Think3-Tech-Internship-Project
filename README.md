# Think3-Tech-Internship-Project
This program was made to parse through a .json file of old tickets the company had so that they could search and find specific entries. It is not a file they access often, but they were paying $40 a month for a  service to parse it for them. This program is simple, with no GUI, but it allowed them to shave off unneeded expenses each month. 
I will omit the .json file itself, seeing as it has names and personal information in it. The .json file this program was made for is irregular, as I found out through a bit of research it is actually in a json lines format. This means every entry is its own object, which is slightly different from a standard json file hierarchy. Having not had much experience with json files before this project, I used the methods I knew best at the time to make the file parseable.
