# Think3-Tech-Internship-Project
This program was made to parse through a .json file of old tickets the company had so that they could search and find specific entries. It is not a file they access often, but they were paying $40 a month fora  service to parse it for them. This program is simple, with no GUI, but it allowed them to shave off unneeded expenses each month.
